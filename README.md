The crucial objective of the Project is analysis customers behavior of the online shop.
In short , i have 5 main goals for that project:

- Perform an LTV cohort analysis
- Building a sales funnel
- Predict churn using classification
- Run an A/B test to improve the conversion rate
- Build a dashboard (Streamlit)

For first i downloaded dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce and created sql table using python (CreateTheTable.py). 
After that by using MySqlWorkbench (prcnt.sql) found out that more than 1 order made only 0.019032 of all customers in average . 
(https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca790e8d-ac03-4036-80e4-ca86c6e4216b) - here you can see their activity by months, that is a bad dynamics for marketplace also i can say the same thing about all customers lifecycle activity , only 3% of all customers made more than 1 order for all dataset lifetime. 
Easy to say that that marketplace in a big trouble because one of the main goals of buisnes - keeping clients.
